look inside-python-object:
Python has a strong set of introspection features.

Take a look at the following built-in functions:
    type()
    dir()
    id()
    getattr()
    hasattr()
    globals()
    locals()
    callable()

type() and dir() are particularly useful for inspecting the type of an object and its set of attributes, respectively.
